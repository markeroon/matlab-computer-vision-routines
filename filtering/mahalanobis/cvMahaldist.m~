% Synopsis
%   [d] = cvMahaldist(X, Y)
%
% Description
%   Compute mahalanobis distance between X and Y.  
%
% Inputs ([]s are optional)
%   (matrix) X        D x N matrix where D is the dimension of vectors
%                     and N is the number of vectors.
%   (matrix) Y        D x P matrix where D is the dimension of vectors
%                     and P is the number of vectors.
%
% Outputs ([]s are optional)
%   (matrix) d        N x P matrix where d(n,p) represents the mahalanobis
%                     distance between X(:,n) and Y(:,p).
%
% Examples
%   X = [1 2
%        1 2];
%   Y = [1 2 3
%        1 2 3];
%   d = cvMahaldist(X, Y)
