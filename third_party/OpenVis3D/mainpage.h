/** \mainpage OpenVis3D: Open Source 3D Vision Library
*  \anchor openvis3dmain
* <p>The goal of this project is to provide a library of efficient 3D computer vision routines for image and video processing. It currently includes routines for dense stereo matching, optical flow (motion) estimation, occlusion detection, and egomotion (3D self-motion) estimation. </p>
