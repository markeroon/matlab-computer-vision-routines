%FINDPOINTSTOREGISTER Find the points in X that are near points
% in Y_ur
% We wish to find the k-nearest neighbours that are within a reasonable
% distance
% X - the set of reference points to which the points in Y_u are going to
% be fittted
% Y_ur - the unregistered (ur) points of Y
% k - the number of neighbouring points in X to each Y_ur that we wish
% to register
% max_allowable_dist - if the nearest neighbour is greater than this 
% distance, it is likely that the scans do not overlap in this area
